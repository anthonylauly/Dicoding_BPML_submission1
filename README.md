Fake News Detection using LSTM

Dataset used: Fake and real news dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

Eliminate unnecessary words such by using nltk stopwords. Remove punctuation which is less important for fake news classifying. Tokenize the resulting sentences. Last step is implement the LSTM Model.

Works done in Google Colab, LSTM Model built in Tensorflow 2.
